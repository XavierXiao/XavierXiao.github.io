I am a final year Ph.D. student in [Computational and Applied Mathematics](https://cam.uchicago.edu) at University of Chicago. My advisor is [Yali Amit](https://galton.uchicago.edu/~amit/). I also work with [Arash Vahdat](http://latentspace.cc/arash_vahdat/) and [Karsten Kreis](https://scholar.google.de/citations?hl=de&user=rFd-DiAAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) at Nvidia. <br>

I obtained my bachelor's degrees in Applied Mathematics and Statistics from UC Berkeley in 2017. <br>

My research mainly focuses on deep probablistic generative models (including [VAEs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.02691), [normalizing flows](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.02762), [energy-based models](https://deepgenerativemodels.github.io/assets/slides/cs236_lecture11.pdf) and [diffusion models](https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/2021/07/11/diffusion-models.html#nice)) and optimization. <br>
