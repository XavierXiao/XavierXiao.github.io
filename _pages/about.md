I am a 4th-year Ph.D. student in [Computational and Applied Mathematics](https://cam.uchicago.edu) at University of Chicago. My advisor is [Yali Amit](https://galton.uchicago.edu/~amit/). I also work with [Arash Vahdat](http://latentspace.cc/arash_vahdat/) at Nvidia. <br>

I obtained my bachelor's degrees in Applied Mathematics and Statistics from UC Berkeley in 2017. <br>

My research mainly focuses on deep probablistic generative models and optimization. <br>
