I recently defensed my thesis with title *Designing Deep Generative Models with Symbiotic Composition*. Here is a [copy](https://xavierxiao.github.io/files/thesis_final-compressed.pdf) of my thesis. I will join [AWS AI](https://aws.amazon.com/ai/) as an Applied Scientist after graduation.<br>

Currently I am a final year Ph.D. student in [Computational and Applied Mathematics](https://cam.uchicago.edu) at University of Chicago. I am doing my Ph.D. studies under Prof. [Yali Amit](https://galton.uchicago.edu/~amit/). During two summer internships at [NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/research/), I worked with [Arash Vahdat](http://latentspace.cc/arash_vahdat/) and [Karsten Kreis](https://karstenkreis.github.io/). <br>

My research mainly focuses on deep probablistic generative models (including [VAEs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.02691), [normalizing flows](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.02762), [energy-based models](https://deepgenerativemodels.github.io/assets/slides/cs236_lecture11.pdf) and [diffusion models](https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/2021/07/11/diffusion-models.html#nice)) and optimization. Besides, I have general interests in unsupervised learning techniques. <br>

Previously, I obtained my bachelor's degrees in Applied Mathematics and Statistics from UC Berkeley in 2017. <br>
