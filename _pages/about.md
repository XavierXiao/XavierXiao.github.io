I am currently an Applied Scientist at [AWS AI](https://aws.amazon.com/ai/). In particular, I am part of the [Lookout for Vision](https://aws.amazon.com/lookout-for-vision/) team, working on applying computer vision algorithm to industrial anomaly detection.

I recently graduated from University of Chicago with a Ph.D. degree in [Computational and Applied Mathematics](https://cam.uchicago.edu). I did my Ph.D. studies under Prof. [Yali Amit](https://galton.uchicago.edu/~amit/). During two summer internships at [NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/research/), I worked with [Arash Vahdat](http://latentspace.cc/arash_vahdat/) and [Karsten Kreis](https://karstenkreis.github.io/). My research mainly focuses on deep probablistic generative models and optimization. Besides, I have general interests in unsupervised learning techniques. Here is a [copy](https://www.proquest.com/docview/2685089373/80A94B2C787149FFPQ/9?accountid=14657) of my Ph.D. thesis. <br>

Previously, I obtained my bachelor's degrees in Applied Mathematics and Statistics from UC Berkeley in 2017. <br>
