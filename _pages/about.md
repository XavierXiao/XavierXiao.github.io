I currently work at Google on improving the efficiency of large-scale text-to-image diffusion models, such as [Imagen 2](https://deepmind.google/technologies/imagen-2/).

Previously I was an Applied Scientist at [AWS AI](https://aws.amazon.com/ai/). At AWS, I was working on training large diffusion-based generative models, which finally turned into [Titan Image Generator](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/titan/).

I graduated from University of Chicago with a Ph.D. degree in [Computational and Applied Mathematics](https://cam.uchicago.edu) in June 2022. I did my Ph.D. studies under Prof. [Yali Amit](https://galton.uchicago.edu/~amit/). During two wonderful summer internships at [NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/research/), I worked with [Arash Vahdat](http://latentspace.cc/arash_vahdat/) and [Karsten Kreis](https://karstenkreis.github.io/). My research mainly focuses on deep probablistic generative models and optimization. Besides, I have general interests in unsupervised learning techniques. Here is a [copy](https://knowledge.uchicago.edu/record/3954) of my Ph.D. thesis. <br>

I obtained my bachelor's degrees in Applied Mathematics and Statistics from UC Berkeley in 2017. <br>
